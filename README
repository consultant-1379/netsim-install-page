#[[ NOTES ]]
#
# === This repository is for Netsim Install Page PHP application files.
# === It attempts to capture all files referenced by the application, and mimic (NOT mirror) the directory structure as close as possible.
# === Some of the files referenced by the application are stored on other servers.
# === The files in the database directory are for re-creating the databases used in the PHP application (STRUCTURE only, NO DATA).
